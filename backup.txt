        "text": "3.2.1.....go\n\nHere's my story of not even being able to run 200 metres to running my first marathon of 21 Kms\n\nThe story started when in the 07th month of 2024, I was stopped from donating blood due to my low hemoglobin count.\n\nI was furious.\n\nSo, much that I started documenting my journey at navneet[dot]life/health\n\nThe easiest one was to start running.\n\nand it didn't come easy to me.\nI went through hell ( as goggins says )\n\n-> I ran naked.\n-> I ran barefoot.\n-> I ran in slippers.\n-> I ran while fasting.\n-> I ran when it rained.\n-> I ran in cold at 3 am.\n-> I ran when everyone else was sleeping.\n\nI ran and ran and ran.\n\n( now averaging 5 kms per day )\n\nThus it took me about 7 months to run my first marathon and to complete it.\n\nIt was lucknow half marathon of 21Kms.\n\nProud to say that I am NOW a marathon runner.\n\nSorry for not being active on the platform.\n\nPS: All video documentation links are in the comments.\n\nPPS: Do you have such a story. If yes share in the comments.\n\n---------\nSigning off\nNavneet - The letters \u2709\ufe0f guy",
